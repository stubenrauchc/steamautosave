replace UserName with windows username, YOUR STEAM ID with your steam ID, SAVEFILENAME.xml with the actual save file name
the 300 is 5 minutes in seconds, adjust as you want, 
replace noita.exe with the name of the game, maybe reka.exe idk, check task manager when the game is running
and finally, right click on the game in steam, click properties, on the general tab, put the full file path of where the autosave.bat file is, followed by %command%, example: C:\Users\username\OneDrive\Documents\autosave.bat %command%
